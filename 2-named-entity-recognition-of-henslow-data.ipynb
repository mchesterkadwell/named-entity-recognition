    "## NER with Machine Learning using spaCy\n",
    "[spaCy](https://spacy.io) is a free and open-source package that can be used to perform automated named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning how to work with spaCy more broadly for a variety of NLP tasks I recommend the beginner's tutorial [Natural Language Processing with spaCy in Python](https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/) and, for intermediate programmers, the book [Natural Language Processing with Python and spaCy](https://nostarch.com/NLPPython).\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy uses a form of machine learning called **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) for named entity recognition. The nature of these neural networks is out of scope for this workshop, but in general terms a CNN produces a **statistical model** that is used to **predict** what are the most likely named entities in a text. This type of machine learning is described as being **supervised**, which means it must be trained on data that has been correctly labelled with named entities before it can do automated labelling on data it's never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a statistical technique, the predictions might be wrong; in fact, they often are, and it's usually necessary to re-train and adjust the model until its predictions are better. We will cover training a model in the following notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't need to start completely from scratch because spaCy provides a range of [pre-trained language models](https://spacy.io/usage/models#languages) for modern languages such as English, Spanish, French and German. For other languages you can train your own and use them with spaCy or re-train one of the existing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The English models that spaCy offers have been trained on the [OntoNotes corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19). These models can predict the following entities 'out of the box':\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **named entity** is defined as any type of real-world object or concept that is assigned a name or proper name.\n",
    "- The Python library **BeautifulSoup** can parse text in XML, which is useful for extracting the text of Henslow letters marked up in TEI.\n",
    "- The Python library **spaCy** can predict named entities by using an English language model that has been pre-trained using machine learning on a corpus of general modern texts.\n",
    "- spaCy can recognise certain **pre-defined** named entities 'out of the box'.\n",
    "- The **predictions** made by spaCy's default model are quite good but suffer from some inaccuracies.\n",
    "- spaCy can **visualise** the named entity labels within the context of the original text so we can better assess the accuracy of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [next notebook](3-principles-of-machine-learning-for-named-entities.ipynb) we will look in more detail at how machine learning **models** make **predictions** about named entities, how to improve the predictions by **training** the model and how to create **training data** by labelling data manually.
