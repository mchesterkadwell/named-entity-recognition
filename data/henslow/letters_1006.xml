                  <p>I trust I am ready to maintain  my own opinion of the utter inexpediency of the movement against the Post Office &amp; I care not at all about its being known. But I would not advise Lord Clanricarde to name me as an authority as he would be more likely to damage his cause than otherwise - for I have no weight as [illeg] - &amp; my opinion would be spurned by the party who take so strict a view of Sunday as many &amp; perhaps most of the clergy are now doing. This has been a growing conviction with many zealous men - though I see no grounds whatever for believing them to be right - rather i condider them to be utterly wrong. I was one of a minority in Cambridge who opposed the closing of a reading room on Sunday in our Philosophical Society, some years ago -  &amp; I am sure I found myself in the company of as really good Christians &amp; right minded men as were any of those who were so clamorous for our not allowing any one to read a newspaper on a Sunday. It would be giving mortal offence to the prejudices of those who fanct the Jewish Sabbath to be of perpetual obligation that our Lords day is not under the control of the Church, if I were to confess my own convictions that our faithful predecessors in the Church of England acted wisely in sanctioning innocent recreation on Sunday - but I am nevertheless most thoroughly convinced in my own mind that we are become too puritanical &amp; too formal in such matters. To open anything like a religious discussion of the questions in the House would perhaps be impudent (if I my venture to say so) - but I sould think there was enough of common sense among the majority (as there have hitherto been) to refuse to listen to such petitions which Mr W Wilson (whowever he may be) is endevouring to set up. However, so far as I am concerned, you are prefectly at liberty to state what my opinion is, and if Lord Clanricarde really thinks my name would not do him more harm than good he is quite at liberty to make use of it. I dare say I shall be called an Infidel - &amp; an esteemed opponent of all true religion - but as my conscience is perfectly clear of any desire to oppose the truth if I am doing so I can only pray to have a better judgement allowed me. </p>
                    <p>Very truly yours</p>
