                  <p>I fear you will think that I have quite forgotten my promise of sending you some of my duplicates of rare plants. On looking over the last list of your desiderata I am quite sorry to see how few there are which I am at present able to supply.</p>
                  <p>I think there are only 8 or 9 to which I have added about 20 species of plants which are not absolutely common. But I still consider it a very poor return for the valuable parcel you sent me almost every species of which was rare or local.</p>
                  <p>In the course of the Season I hope to meet with some more of your desiderata &amp; expect in a few days to get one of them <hi rend="underline">Leucojum aestivum</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Barbadoes Seeds were old &amp; I did not hear from you I sowed them that no time might be lost. They are now many of them growing &amp; should you wish for any when they will bear removal they are at your service. The Noyau Berries vegetated very freely. In putting by specimens for me I beg you will not (where you have them to spare) confine yourself to my list of desiderata as I have several correspondents in the North who are very desirous of getting some of the rare Southern Plants particularly the local ones of Cambridge. I am writing this in great haste for the Coach &amp; must therefore conclude.</p>
                  <p>Believe me my dear Sir | yours very truly | W. Christy J <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
